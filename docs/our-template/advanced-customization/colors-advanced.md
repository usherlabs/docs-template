# Colors (Advanced)

This guide explains how to customize colors more deeply in your Usher project, including modifying the colors CSS file, custom components, and tweaking component files.

## **Colors CSS File**

To modify the colors CSS file, locate the **`src/styles/colors.scss`** file in your project. You can add, remove or modify the color variables according to your requirements.

For more information on working with colors in Docusaurus, refer to the **[official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout#styling)**.

## **Custom Components**

If you're working with custom components, you can adjust the colors for these components by modifying the appropriate component styles. You can find custom component styles in the **`src/components`** directory.

## **Tweaking Docusaurus Components**

To further customize the appearance of Docusaurus Components, you can tweak the files located in the **`src/theme`** directory. Be sure to modify the corresponding stylesheets in the **`src/styles/components`** directory as needed. These get included to the global stylesheet.
