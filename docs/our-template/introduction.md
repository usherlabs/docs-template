# Welcome to Usher docs template

:::warning
This template offers basic and advanced customizations. Basic customizations are typically necessary for giving a project its identity, while advanced customizations should be used sparingly, as they can be confusing and error-prone.
:::

Our template files usually include several `INITIAL TODO` comments to help you find the right places to start making changes. Additionally, this mini documentation is intentionally focused on scoped features that are more deeply available at [Docusaurus Guide Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides).

### Colors

Here you'll be able to define less main colors, without having to deal with different shades of them.

### Typography

We've provided by default our brand's main typography, but you can always customize it.

### Branding

You'll be able to define logos, phrases and links as you please, however we've provided good defaults.

### Layout

We offer a pretty good default customized layout. However, you can always change it if necessary.


### Custom Components
We've created a few custom components that you can use in your templates. These components are designed to enhance the look and feel of your documentation, making it easier to communicate complex ideas and concepts.

Refer to our [Custom Components](./advanced-customization/custom-components.md) documentation for more details on how to use these components in your templates.
