# **About docs-template**

This docs-template provides a starting point for creating project documentation using Docusaurus 2 and Tailwind CSS. This README  covers how to use the template, contribute to its development, and follow best practices.

## **Features**

- TailwindCSS integration
- Dark-mode
- Mobile & desktop ready
- Optional integrations:
    - Algolia search
    - Google Tag Manager
    - Google Analytics

# Initial structure

- No homepage
- No footer
- Social links and other useful Usher links at the navigation bar

## **How to use the template**

1. Use the repository as a GitHub template â€” RECOMMENDED, or
2. Download and extract the ZIP file, or
3. Perform a shallow clone to create a new project without inheriting the template's Git history.

Conveniently, most parts of this template that needs to be changed are accompanied by an `INITIAL TODO` comment. Read this README before, then find them all on your project to change accordingly.

Example:

```json
{ 
	// ...
	title: "My Usher Site", // INITIAL TODO
	// ...
}
```

# Contributing to the Template

We encourage you to contribute by:

## Proposing

- Components that are useful for many documentation projects.
- Improvements to the configuration for better usability.
- Better comments to make our default tooling more accessible.

## Reporting

- Poor DX or any other issues that cause friction.
- Bug reports.

Below here is a basic structure to maintain at your docs README

# ðŸ“– **Welcome to {project} Documentation repository**

This is the home of {project} docs! Here, we aim to help our users make the best of it, so they may {brief explanation of what the project helps them achieve}.

{donâ€™t forget to link the original project repository, if it exists}

This website is built using **[Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/)**, a static website generator.

# **Get started**

## **Installation**

```sh
$ pnpm install

```

## **Local Development**

```sh
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

# C**ustomization**

## **Creating and organizing content**

- Store content in the **`docs`** directory, supporting **`.md`** and **`.mdx`** files. **[Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc)**
- Configure each folder metadata accordingly, using`_category_.json`Â orÂ `_category_.yml`. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#category-item-metadata)
- Utilize frontmatter options for configuration and customization. **[See the API here â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter)**
- Set a specific page as the main page [link] (if you do not intend to create a dedicated homepage. Otherwise, to create a homepage learn more here)
- Configure header navigation items in the **`docusaurus.config.js`** file. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-multi-instance#docs-navbar-items)
- Create multiple sidebars by updating **`sidebars.js`** according to your docs folder structure. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/multiple-sidebars)

**Example of a tree structure in the `docs` folder:**

```
docs
â”œâ”€â”€ getting-started
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ introduction.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ installation.md
â””â”€â”€ guides
    â”œâ”€â”€ configuration.md
    â””â”€â”€ customization.md

```

**Using the autogenerated sidebar:**

```js
module.exports = {
  sidebars: {
    gettingStarted: [
      {
        type: 'autogenerated',
        dirName: 'getting-started',
      },
    ],
    guides: [
      {
        type: 'autogenerated',
        dirName: 'guides',
      },
    ],
  },
};

```

This will generate separate sidebars for the **`getting-started`** and **`guides`** folders. Adjust the header navigation items in **`docusaurus.config.js`** accordingly.

Ensure you update both the **`sidebars.js`** file and the header navigation items in **`docusaurus.config.js`** when changing the documentation structure, providing a seamless navigation experience for users.

## **Customization**

### **Basic customization**

- Change fonts following instructions at `tailwind.config.ts`
- Modify typography settings at `tailwind.config.ts`
- Update colors at `tailwind.config.ts`

### **Advanced customization**

- Apply component-specific styles at specific `module.css` files
- Use mdx and React. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react)
- Swizzle built-in components or update our modifications at `src/theme/*` files. [Learn more about Swizzling â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling)
- Develop custom React pages at `src/pages`. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages#add-a-react-page)

# **Best practices**

- When swizzling components, add comments to indicate where changes occurred
- Follow Docusaurus-specific best practices for versioning and customization. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning#recommended-practices)

# **Deployment**

## **Build**

```sh
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the **`build`** directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Documentation d**eployment guidelines**

{Insert docs deployment guidelines here; i.e.: how to deploy with vercel}

e.g.:

To deploy your documentation with Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a **[Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)** if you don't have one.
2. Install the **[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download)** by running **`npm i -g vercel`**.
3. Run **`vercel login`** in your terminal and log in using your Vercel account.
4. In your project directory, run **`vercel`** to initiate the deployment process. Follow the prompts to link your project to Vercel.
5. Once your project is linked, Vercel will deploy your documentation. After the deployment, you'll receive a URL to access your live documentation.

For subsequent deployments, run **`vercel --prod`** in your project directory to deploy your documentation to the production environment.

For more information on Vercel deployments, consult the **[official Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)**.
